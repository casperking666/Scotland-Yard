# Scotland-Yard

This repository held the work done for the OOP pair programming project.

The task was to implement a software version of the board game [Scotland Yard](https://www.ravensburger.org/spielanleitungen/ecm/Spielanleitungen/26646%20anl%202050897_2.pdf). Given a skeleton that consists of the supporting packages and the GUI, the goal was to programmed the logic and the mechanism of the game.
